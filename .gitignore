------------------------authentication--------------------------------------------
Yes or no replies for authentication are not sufficient because they lack specificity and can be easily exploited by attackers using techniques like brute force.

Server-side sessions store user data on the server, allowing the server to remember user information between requests.

The problem with server-side sessions is that they can lead to scalability issues as the server has to manage and store session data for each user.

Authentication tokens are secure, random strings generated upon successful authentication. They are typically used as proof of authentication and can be included in subsequent requests to access protected resources.

Authentication tokens are often considered better than server-side sessions because they reduce the server's storage load, enhance scalability, and provide a stateless way of handling authentication, making them more suitable for distributed systems and APIs.
